To compile my connected-components program, navigate to the folder containing the source code and Makefile.  I you want to build with the G++ compier, simply type "make" or "make all" and both the serial(connectd) and parallel(paralel) versions of the program will be built with G++.  To build with the Intel icpc compiler, again navigate to the folder containing source and Makefile.  Then, type "module load intel" to make the Intel compiler available.  Finally, type "make intel" and the Intel compiler will build both serial and parallel versions of the program.
